**Phase 2 Ops Packaging**
- Captured the repo scan plus the Block B/C work plan for this checkpoint in `docs/analysis/p2-c7-ops-packaging-baseline.md:1`, so the UI requirements, env vars, and verification checklist are documented before the implementation.
- Added the UI packaging bits: new env template at `ops/env/pv-ui.env.example:1`, a systemd unit at `ops/systemd/prompt-valet-ui.service:1`, and operator-guide text that now spells out the manual `PV_* ./scripts/pv_ui.py` startup, systemd copy/start/enable commands, connectivity checks, and troubleshooting notes for live API health at `docs/ops/phase1-operator-guide.md:88`.
- Added the Phase 2 baseline procedure (`docs/phase2/baseline.md:1`) with the happy-path steps, verification checklist, and the “UI failure does not impact execution” note, plus the debrief story at `docs/phase2/phase-debrief.md:1` that ties those artifacts back to the roadmaps without introducing future-phase speculation.
- Roadmaps now mention P2·C7 and point operators at the new docs, and the tracker marks the checkpoint complete (`docs/phase-roadmap.md:25`, `docs/Phase_Roadmap.md:25`, `PHASE_CHECKLIST.md:1`).
