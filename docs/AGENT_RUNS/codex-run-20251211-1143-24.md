Branch-aware jobs now surface their inbox branch explicitly and the watcher sync/PR logic uses that branch every step of the way, including a guard that fails jobs when the upstream branch is missing.

- **Job metadata** — `Job` exposes `repo_name`/`branch_name`, `from_inbox_path()` parses `<repo>/<branch>/…` layouts, and the parser raises when the branch segment is absent so we never invent `main` (`scripts/pv_jobs.py:60`‑`163`).
- **Watcher flow** — Added remote-branch discovery + `get_job_base_branch()`, a dedicated `MissingBaseBranchError`, and updated repo prep + PR creation to fetch/checkout/push against the inbox branch (and to raise when that branch is absent upstream) rather than hard‑coding `main` (`scripts/codex_watcher.py:202`, `:924`, `:936`, `:1002`, `:1126`).
- **Tests** — `tests/test_pv_jobs.py:128` validates inbox-path parsing; `tests/test_git_preflight.py:20` now expects the configurable base branch during preflight; `tests/test_queue_watcher.py:210` asserts repo prep and PR creation honor the job’s branch.

Testing:
- `pytest -q`
