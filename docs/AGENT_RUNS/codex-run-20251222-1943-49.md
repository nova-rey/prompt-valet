Centralized the test scaffolding (removing the repetitive `sys.path` magic) and made CI treat Ruff/Black failures as blockers so the repo stays formatted and linted.

- **Tests** – Added `tests/conftest.py:1` to share the project-root sys.path insertion, allowing the tests to drop their duplicate setup and unused locals (e.g., `tests/test_e2e_dry_run.py:118`, `tests/test_queue_runtime.py:74`, `tests/test_queue_watcher.py:56`) while keeping Ruff happy.
- **CI** – The existing workflow now waits for the lint job before running tests (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:10`) and executes blocking `ruff check .` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:55`) plus `black --check .` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:59`) after installing the lint tools.
- **Formatting** – Running `black .` touched the existing modules (e.g., `scripts/codex_watcher.py:170` and `scripts/queue_runtime.py:1`) purely for formatting.
- **Testing** – `ruff check .`, `black .`, `black --check .`, `pytest -q` (all pass).
- **Behavior** – No runtime behavior changes introduced.

Next steps: 1. Monitor the new `Lint & Format` job on PRs/pushes to ensure the stricter enforcement keeps succeeding.
