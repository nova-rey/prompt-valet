Installed `python-multipart` in the runtime dependencies so every install now provides multipart support without needing optional extras (`pyproject.toml:10`).

Operator docs now note that the official install (still `python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"`) pulls in `python-multipart` and that uploads accept any `.md` file while still writing job-id-aware `.prompt.md` artifacts that the watcher understands (`docs/p1-c3-api.md:9`, `docs/p1-c3-api.md:16`).

API tests now assert that plain `.md` uploads succeed, that generated inbox files embed the job ID, and that they keep the `.prompt.md` suffix (`tests/test_p1_c4_job_submission.py:124`).

Commands: `python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"` (fails: `python` binary missing; reran as `python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"`), `ruff check .`, `black --check .`, `pytest -q`.

Watcher behavior remains untouched—job submission still yields `.prompt.md` files so the existing watcher semantics continue to work as before.
