- Added `tests/test_e2e_dry_run.py` that builds a temporary Prompt Valet root (inbox/processed/repos/finished/config), writes a minimal YAML config, creates a local repo with origin/main, inserts a `.prompt.md`, patches `rebuild_inbox_tree`/`codex_watcher` globals + runner/PR helpers, and then calls the tree-builder `main()` plus `codex_watcher.main(["--once"])` to verify inbox→processed movement, processed prompt copying, and the expected watcher log line without calling the real Codex CLI or touching `/srv`.
- Scripts helpers: none were added or modified; the production code remained untouched thanks to the monkeypatch-based stubs.
- Tests: `pytest -q`
