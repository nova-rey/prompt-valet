**Docs Update**
- Seeded `/docs/` with the prescribed Bible, design, architecture, filesystem, overview, roadmap, and future-work markdowns so the checkpoint content matches the spec.
- Authored `docs/Config_Spec.md` to mirror `configs/codex-runner.yaml`, describing each tree_builder and watcher key along with the embedded comments and defaults.
- Augmented `docs/Architecture.md` with an agent-generated “Python Structure Analysis” section summarizing `codex_watcher.py` and `rebuild_inbox_tree.py`, covering their control flow, config loading, path handling, cloning logic, and how they invoke the Codex runner.

List of created/modified files:
- `docs/Bible.md`
- `docs/Design_Philosophy.md`
- `docs/Architecture.md`
- `docs/Filesystem.md`
- `docs/Config_Spec.md`
- `docs/Prompt_Valet_Overview.md`
- `docs/Phase_Roadmap.md`
- `docs/Future_Work.md`

Confirmations:
- No Python files were altered during this checkpoint.
- All required docs were written and reflect the current repo truth.

Next step: stage these docs and then proceed with the Phase 1·C2 rename and config migration work when ready.
