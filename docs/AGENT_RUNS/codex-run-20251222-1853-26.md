Formalized the Phase 1 job contract with a dedicated analysis write-up (`docs/analysis/p1-c1-job-contract.md:1`) and a machine-readable schema (`schemas/job_record.schema.json:1`), so the state machine, schema, invariants, derived fields, and atomic write expectations are all captured before any runtime wiring.

- `scripts/queue_runtime.py:13-205` now persistently names the metadata file `job.json`, enforces UUIDv4 job IDs, validates payloads against the schema, guards each state transition, and writes both `job.json` and `state` atomically so the queue helpers embody the contract.
- `scripts/queue_runtime.py:205-304` continues to load/persist jobs but now reads the validated `job.json`, writes through `_write_job`, and rejects corrupt entries before creating `JobRecord` instances.
- `tests/test_queue_runtime.py:18`/`tests/test_queue_runtime.py:117` were updated to assert against the new `JOB_FILE` constant so the test suite exercises the renamed file.
- `PHASE_CHECKLIST.md:3` records that P1·C1 is complete per the checkpoint tracking doc.

Tests:
- `pytest -q` (pass)
- `ruff check .` (fails; the repo currently has longstanding E402/F811/F841 warnings from the sys.path tweaks and unused variables in the `tests/` modules that predate this change)
- `black --check .` (fails; multiple tracked files such as `tests/test_basic_ci.py` and `scripts/codex_watcher.py` would be reformatted by Black)

Next steps:
1. Resolve the existing `ruff`/`black` complaints if you want these lints to pass across the entire repo once the new job contract helpers and artifacts are in place.
