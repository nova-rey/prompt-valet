**Changes**
- Added `JobMetadataWriter`, heartbeat/abort helpers, and job-log wiring so every run now builds a `runs/<job_id>` directory, keeps `job.json/state` in sync, records `pid`/`heartbeat`, and appends the Codex output before/after `run_codex_for_job` returns (`scripts/codex_watcher.py:948`, `scripts/codex_watcher.py:1017`, `scripts/codex_watcher.py:1044`, `scripts/codex_watcher.py:1320`).
- Captured the Block A analysis in `docs/analysis/p1-c2-watcher-instrumentation.md`, detailing how job lifecycle, instrumentation points, heartbeat semantics, and the abort-marker handshake map onto the watcher (`docs/analysis/p1-c2-watcher-instrumentation.md:10`).
- Marked P1·C2 complete with the requested one-line summary so the phase checklist reflects the new instrumentation work (`PHASE_CHECKLIST.md:4`).

**Tests**
- `ruff check .` (pass)
- `black --check .` (pass after formatting)
- `pytest -q` (pass)

Next steps (if desired):
1. Verify in a live run that each `runs/<job_id>/job.log`/`job.json` stream updates while Codex is running and that abort markers terminate the child process as expected.
2. Wire whatever agent issues abort requests to create `runs/<job_id>/ABORT` so the new handshake can be exercised in later phases.
