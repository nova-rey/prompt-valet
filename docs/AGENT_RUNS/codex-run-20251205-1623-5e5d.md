**Analysis**

- No `watcher.yaml` file exists in this checkout; `rg --files -g'watcher.yaml'` comes up empty, and the only mentions of that filename are in docs such as `docs/Filesystem.md` (which describes the runtime layout as `/srv/prompt-valet/config/watcher.yaml`) and other documentation. There are no systemd units, shell scripts, or Python modules that currently refer to `watcher.yaml`.

- The two Python scripts that need to load the shared config are `scripts/codex_watcher.py` and `scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py`. Right now they each hard-code their own fallbacks:
  - `codex_watcher.py` uses `INBOX_DIR = "/srv/prompt-valet/inbox"`, `PROCESSED_DIR = "/srv/prompt-valet/processed"`, `REPOS_ROOT = "/srv/repos"`, and `CONFIG_PATH = "/etc/codex-runner/config.toml"`. Its `DEFAULT_CONFIG` contains `tree_builder` and `watcher` sections with defaults for `auto_clone_missing_repos`, `git_default_*`, `git_protocol`, and `cleanup_non_git_dirs`. `load_config()` merges any TOML data from `CONFIG_PATH` over these defaults and logs only when the file is missing or can’t be read; there is no compact startup summary.
  - `rebuild_inbox_tree.py` uses `INBOX_ROOT = Path("/srv/prompt-valet/inbox")`, `REPOS_ROOT = Path("/srv/repos")`, and `CONFIG_PATH = Path("/srv/prompt-valet/config/codex-runner.yaml")`. Its `DEFAULT_CONFIG` again covers `tree_builder` and `watcher` keys but currently does not include `git_protocol`. It loads YAML via `yaml.safe_load()` and logs only on missing/parsing failures.

- Current config loading details:
  - `codex_watcher.py`: merges `DEFAULT_CONFIG` with TOML data from `CONFIG_PATH`, falls back to defaults on missing file or parser errors, and then populates module-level constants (`AUTO_CLONE`, `GIT_DEFAULT_*`, `CLEANUP_*`). All config-related logging today happens only when the file is absent or unreadable; there’s no single startup log that details the final config values.
  - `rebuild_inbox_tree.py`: does a shallow merge of the YAML config into its `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, and logs missing/parsing issues but not a consolidated summary. The script never prints info about the runner command, or the processed directory, even though those items will soon need to be exposed.

- Target behavior after this checkpoint:
  - Canonical config is `prompt-valet.yaml` under `/srv/prompt-valet/config/`.
  - Both scripts must load that filename via a shared default path, keep their current settings for inbox/processed/repos/git, and emit exactly one concise line at startup in the form `[prompt-valet] loaded config=<path> inbox=<inbox_dir> processed=<processed_dir> git_owner=<owner> git_host=<host> git_protocol=<proto> runner=<cmd>` whenever they start up, even when the config file is missing or only defaults are applied.

**Plan for Section B**

1. **Config file rename/creation:** the repo currently has no `watcher.yaml`, so the first move is to introduce the canonical `prompt-valet.yaml` (by renaming or by creating the file inside the repo’s config directory that mirrors `/srv/prompt-valet/config/`) and keep its contents aligned with the existing `configs/codex-runner.yaml` spec so the scripts can source the right keys.

2. **`codex_watcher.py` overhaul:** update the default config path constant to `/srv/prompt-valet/config/prompt-valet.yaml`, switch the loader to read YAML instead of TOML, keep the same `DEFAULT_CONFIG`, compute `inbox/processed/repos` defaults as before, and immediately after loading emit the required `[prompt-valet] ...` startup line that lists the config path, inbox/processed paths, git owner/host/protocol, and a chosen runner command string (e.g., `"codex exec"`).

3. **`rebuild_inbox_tree.py` tweaks:** point it at the same new YAML path, ensure its watcher defaults include `git_protocol`, possibly define a processed-directory constant for logging, and emit the same `[prompt-valet] ...` line right after the config merge so both scripts share identical startup metadata.

4. **Documentation sweep:** update every `/docs` file that currently says `watcher.yaml` so it instead references `prompt-valet.yaml` (the files discovered by `rg -n watcher.yaml` are `Prompt_Valet_Overview.md`, `Architecture.md`, `Config_Spec.md`, `Phase_Roadmap.md`, `Bible.md`, and `Filesystem.md`), and confirm there are no other auxiliary files or systemd units needing adjustment.

5. **Final checks:** after the edits, run a repo-wide `rg "watcher.yaml"` to prove the string is gone, and run `python -m py_compile` on the two scripts to ensure no syntax issues were introduced while wiring the new config/logging behavior.

I’ll stop here without touching any files and execute Section B once you confirm this plan.
