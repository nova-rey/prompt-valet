Wired the NiceGUI Dashboard to `/api/v1/jobs` so the table refreshes automatically, surfaces heartbeat/stall cues, and opens a detail dialog that enumerates every job field (with the “Logs/Abort” buttons disabled as placeholders). Details live in `prompt_valet/ui/app.py:14-426`.

- **API client** – `PromptValetAPIClient` now exposes `list_jobs()` and `get_job_detail(job_id)` so the UI can fetch job lists and their metadata without duplicating HTTP logic (`prompt_valet/ui/client.py:17-70`).
- **Docs** – Phase analysis and architecture decisions are captured in `docs/analysis/p2-c2-ui-job-visibility.md:1-63`, and `PHASE_CHECKLIST.md:1-10` now marks P2·C2 complete with a one-line summary of the job visibility work.
- **Tests** – Added formatting/unit tests for the new helpers (`tests/test_ui_formatting.py:1-34`) and reran `ruff check .`, `black --check .`, and `pytest -q` (all green). Manual UI validation wasn’t run because the control-plane API wasn’t available in this environment.
- **Out-of-scope** – Submission, log streaming, abort controls, filesystem access, direct Watcher polling, and streaming/SSE remain explicitly disabled as described in `docs/analysis/p2-c2-ui-job-visibility.md:56-63`.

Next steps:
1. Launch the UI against a live control-plane instance, click through the jobs list/detail flow, and verify stalled badges, error banners, and the disabled placeholders behave as expected.
