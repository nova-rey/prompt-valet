- Captured the derivation of the installer requirements (assumptions, env vars, filesystem layout, repo-clone/update behavior, script/systemd contracts, and error handling) in `docs/analysis/P2-C1-analysis.md:3-74`, so downstream work knows why each requirement exists and what files/dirs the new installer will touch.  
- Added the authoritative installer contract at `docs/installer_contract.md:1-110`, detailing scope, dependencies, config schema, script deployment rules, systemd units, optional Copyparty integration, public env vars, and verification expectations that Phase 2·C2 must satisfy.  
- Introduced `docs/phase-roadmap.md:1-11` to record that P2·C1’s analysis and documentation blocks are done while Block C is pending, linking the analysis and contract artifacts for traceability.

Testing:
- `python3 -m compileall scripts`

Next steps:
1. Begin Phase 2·C2 by implementing the installer shell/systemd wiring to satisfy the contract in `docs/installer_contract.md`.  
2. Once the installer exists, re-run the doc-linked verification checklist and update `docs/phase-roadmap.md` to mark P2·C1 fully complete.
