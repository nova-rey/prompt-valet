Implemented the job submission APIs with job-id-aware filenames, YAML front matter merging, and coverage notes/tests so the FastAPI control plane can drop ready-to-run `.prompt.md` files into the existing inbox tree without touching `runs/`.

**Summary**
- Added `prompt_valet/api/submissions.py` to resolve repo/branch via `list_targets`, enforce `.prompt.md` filenames, merge the required `pv` front matter, and atomically write the generated files before returning the `job_id`/path/timestamp used by `prompt_valet/api/app.py:30-158`’s new `POST /jobs` and `POST /jobs/upload` endpoints (watcher behavior and runs metadata remain untouched). 
- Exercised the API through `tests/test_p1_c4_job_submission.py:46-142`, covering happy-path uploads, front-matter merging, invalid repo rejection, and rejection of non-`.md` uploads.
- Captured the Block A reasoning in `docs/analysis/p1-c4-job-submission.md:1-60`, documenting endpoint semantics, front matter rules, failure modes, atomic writes, and explicit non-goals for future checkpoint work.
- Added `httpx` and `python-multipart` to `[project.optional-dependencies.dev]` so the FastAPI test client can run under the bundled dev extras (`pyproject.toml:16-23`).
- Marked P1·C4 complete in `PHASE_CHECKLIST.md:1-6` so the phase tracker reflects the new job submission work.

**Testing**
- `ruff check .`
- `black --check .`
- `pytest -q`

**Next Steps**
1. Exercise the new endpoints in a staging environment (run the API via `uvicorn`, drop a `.prompt.md` job, and confirm the watcher claims/completes it) to validate the end-to-end flow.
