Implemented the Compose/Upload submission flow so the Submit tab pushes Markdown or `.md` files through the existing API, added the matching API client helpers, and documented the analysis/checklist updates for Phase P2·C3.

- **Submit UI wiring** — `prompt_valet/ui/app.py:431` now renders target selectors, Compose and Upload cards, per-file feedback, and health-gated buttons, while `prompt_valet/ui/app.py:765` hooks the panel into the header ping via `register_connectivity_listener`.
- **API client** — `prompt_valet/ui/client.py:79` introduces `list_targets`, `submit_job`, `upload_jobs`, and the `UploadFilePayload` helpers so all HTTP calls stay centralized.
- **Docs/checklist** — preserved Block A reasoning in `docs/analysis/p2-c3-ui-job-submission.md:1` and recorded the milestone in `PHASE_CHECKLIST.md:11`.

- Tests: `pytest -q`, `ruff check .`, `black --check .`
- Guardrails preserved: UI only reads via `PromptValetAPIClient`, no filesystem touching, backend untouched.
- Backend constraints: the new analysis doc (`docs/analysis/p2-c3-ui-job-submission.md:1`) reiterates that submissions need existing repo/branch targets and that uploads only accept UTF-8 `.md` files as enforced by `/api/v1/jobs` and `/api/v1/jobs/upload`.
- Manual UI verification wasn’t possible in this environment; please launch the NiceGUI service and exercise the Compose + Upload forms to confirm the live behavior.

Next steps:
1. Run NiceGUI locally and try Compose/Upload flows, checking that job IDs appear, links go to `/api/v1/jobs/{job_id}`, and errors mirror the API responses.

Ready for P2·C4.
