**Queue Q2 Design**
- Added `docs/work_queue_phase2_design.md:1` so the Q2 deliverable now spells out the watcher’s enqueue-only intake, job metadata layout, executor loop, retry transitions, inbox movement policies, logging schema, and `queue.enabled` compatibility guarantees without any implementation yet.
- The doc ends with the requested ASCII diagram and concise summary, giving Q3 the architecture map needed to implement deterministic queue handling.

Next steps:
1. Build the queue-aware watcher/executor flows per this spec so that jobs travel from `job.created` through `job.failed.final` while respecting the documented movement and logging rules.
2. Confirm instrumentation/emitter expectations in Q3 so logs match the schema (job_id, state, repo, branch, reason).
