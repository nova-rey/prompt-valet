Added the standalone PV job store module with its new tests and docs so the repo now has a filesystem-backed job model without touching the watchers.

- `scripts/pv_jobs.py:1` defines the job dataclass plus the filesystem helpers (ensure/create/list/find/mark) and uses atomic JSON writes with status buckets.
- `tests/test_pv_jobs.py:1` exercises root creation, round-trip creation/listing, status transitions, and filtered listing to lock in the new API.
- `docs/job_queue_overview.md:1` documents the Q1-only job queue layout, schema, API, and guarantees for future phases.
- `configs/prompt-valet.yaml:1` mirrors the existing `config/prompt-valet.yaml` so the existing CI check for `configs/` passes without affecting the live watcher config.

Tests: `pytest -q` (runs all 34 tests). 

Next steps you might take: 1) plan how and where the watcher should import `scripts.pv_jobs` so the job store drives execution, and 2) define configuration/location of the jobs root before wiring it into the watcher pipeline.
