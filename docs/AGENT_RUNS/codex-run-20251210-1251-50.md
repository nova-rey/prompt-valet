Now `codex_watcher` loads `/etc/prompt-valet/prompt-valet.yaml`, resolves the configured `pv_root`, logs it, and defaults inbox/processed/finished/repos under that root so it no longer tries to create `/srv/prompt-valet` whenever a tmp config overrides the root.

- `scripts/codex_watcher.py:40` now points `DEFAULT_CONFIG_PATH` at `/etc/prompt-valet/prompt-valet.yaml` and defines `DEFAULT_PV_ROOT`, while `load_config` (`scripts/codex_watcher.py:683`) tracks which keys were supplied, resolves/logs the configured `pv_root`, defaults missing directories under that root, and returns `(cfg, pv_root)` so `main` (`scripts/codex_watcher.py:1073`) can reuse those resolved paths downstream.
- `scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py:34`/`scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py:86` also mention `/etc/prompt-valet/prompt-valet.yaml` so the tree builder stays aligned with the watcher’s canonical config path.
- `tests/test_basic_ci.py:32` was updated to expect the new `/etc` path in both scripts’ sources.
- `tests/test_e2e_dry_run.py:43` now writes `pv_root` into its fixture config so the dry-run uses the tmp root for both the tree builder and watcher.
- `tests/test_codex_watcher_config_root.py:15` adds a regression test that monkeypatches the config path, spies on `Path.mkdir`, and asserts that only the tmp `pv_root` is created (never `/srv/prompt-valet`).

- Tests: `pytest -q`

Docs such as `docs/Prompt_Valet_Overview.md:42` still describe `/srv/prompt-valet/config/prompt-valet.yaml`; consider updating them if `/etc/prompt-valet/prompt-valet.yaml` is now meant to be the canonical runtime config location.
