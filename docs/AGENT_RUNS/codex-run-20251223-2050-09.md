**Changes**
- Added streaming/tail/abort helpers and wired log-tail, SSE-stream, and abort endpoints so the API can read logs, follow live output, and handshake via `ABORT` without touching watcher state (`prompt_valet/api/app.py:37`, `prompt_valet/api/app.py:197`).
- Captured the endpoint semantics, failure modes, and non-goals in the new analysis artifact for P1·C5 (`docs/analysis/p1-c5-logs-and-abort.md:1`).
- Added regression tests for the new log/abort behavior and marked P1·C5 complete in the phase checklist (`tests/test_p1_c5_logs_and_abort.py:1`, `PHASE_CHECKLIST.md:7`).

**Testing**
- `ruff check .`
- `black --check .`
- `pytest -q`

1. Exercise the new log/stream/abort endpoints against a running watcher job to confirm the SSE lifecycle and abort handshake behave end-to-end in a live environment.
