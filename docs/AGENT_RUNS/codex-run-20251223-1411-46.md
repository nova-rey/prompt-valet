- Added `pyproject.toml` with PEP 621 metadata, shared dependencies (FastAPI, Uvicorn, PyYAML), dev extras, Ruff/Black settings, and limited package discovery so `pip install -e ".[dev]"` now targets just `prompt_valet` (`pyproject.toml:5`, `pyproject.toml:10`, `pyproject.toml:16`, `pyproject.toml:23`, `pyproject.toml:29`), while relaxing `requires-python` to `>=3.10` so local installs succeed.
- Simplified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to a single matrix job that upgrades pip, installs `.[dev]`, and runs `ruff`, `black`, and `pytest` in sequence (`.github/workflows/ci.yml:10`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml:27`–`.github/workflows/ci.yml:42`).
- Updated the Phase 1·C3 API operator sheet to recommend installing via the manifest and remind readers how to launch `scripts/pv_api.py` (`docs/p1-c3-api.md:4`–`docs/p1-c3-api.md:12`).
- Tests: `python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"` (succeeds now that the manifest accepts Python 3.10+), `ruff check .`, `black --check .`, and `pytest -q` (all pass locally); no runtime behavior was changed.
- Next steps: 1) Watch the updated CI job on the next push to ensure the new install path works remotely; 2) Keep documentation in sync if dependencies or scripts move.
