- Documented the full UI contract (endpoints, payloads, expected statuses) plus the deterministic testing strategy for an ASGI stub in `docs/analysis/mp-ui-ci-option-a.md#L5` and `docs/analysis/mp-ui-ci-option-a.md#L17`, fulfilling Block A’s review/plan requirement.
- Built a FastAPI stub with `StubState`-backed targets/jogs (#L48) and an `/api/v1` router (#L152) that mirrors the UI client’s list/submit/upload/log/abort surface so the client can run against real HTTP semantics in tests.
- Added `tests/test_ui_api_contract.py#L12` to exercise every `PromptValetAPIClient` helper against the stub (targets, submit, upload, job detail, log tail, SSE, abort success/409).
- Simulated SSE by streaming the fixed `state.streams` messages through `StreamingResponse` so `stream_job_log` yields deterministic `data:` entries before closing (`tests/fixtures/stub_api.py#L183`).
- To extend the contract harness when UI needs new endpoints, update `StubState`’s dictionaries (#L48) and add a matching route inside `create_stub_app()` (#L152) so the stub continues to serve deterministic responses for the added calls.
- Tests: `pytest -q`, `ruff check .`, `black --check .` (all green).
