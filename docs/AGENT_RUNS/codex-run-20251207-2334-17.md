**Greedy Inboxes**
- Added a GitHub-API helper plus greedy_inboxes wiring so the candidate repo set now absorbs owner-wide repos, logs which ones came from upstream, and still leaves non-greedy or upstream-disabled runs unchanged—allowing owner-only repos like `nova-process` to receive inbox roots without a local clone (scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py:222, scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py:582).
- Exposed `tree_builder.greedy_inboxes` and a `git_api_token_env` default in the canonical config and mirrored the same schema under `configs/` so the CI config check keeps finding an example file (config/prompt-valet.yaml:8, configs/prompt-valet.yaml:8).
- Added targeted tests that confirm greedy expands the repo set, that greedy=False avoids discovery, and that the feature is skipped when upstream is disabled, plus documented the analysis/plan for the mini-push (tests/test_rebuild_inbox_tree_upstream.py:323, tests/test_rebuild_inbox_tree_upstream.py:369, tests/test_rebuild_inbox_tree_upstream.py:407, docs/analysis/mp-greedy-inboxes-analysis.md:1).
