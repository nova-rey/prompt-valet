**Service Visibility**
- The Services tab at `prompt_valet/ui/app.py:1031` now renders Watcher and TreeBuilder cards with live refresh, error hints, and connectivity-aware badges so each card shows status, last heartbeat, and inbox coverage straight from `/status`, `/jobs`, and `/targets`.
- `prompt_valet/ui/client.py:70` now allows filtering `/jobs` requests and `prompt_valet/ui/client.py:99` exposes `/status`; the new paths are exercised in `tests/test_ui_client.py:66` to keep parameter parsing and payload handling safe.
- Recorded the discovery/plan in `docs/analysis/p2-c5-ui-service-visibility.md:1` and flagged checkpoint completion in `PHASE_CHECKLIST.md:1`.
- Tests: `pytest -q`, `ruff check .`, `black --check .` (all passed).
- Restart controls remain unimplemented because Phase 1 exposes no restart APIs (`docs/analysis/p2-c5-ui-service-visibility.md:1`).

Next steps:
1. Exercise the Services tab in a running UI to confirm the cards and refresh button show real data and API errors.
2. Add restart controls later only after backend endpoints surface them so the UI remains purely API-driven.
