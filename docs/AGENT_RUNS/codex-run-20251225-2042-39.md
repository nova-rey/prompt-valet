Added cached update helpers plus the optional `PV_UI_DEBUG_REFRESH` toggle so text/visibility/class changes only happen when the value differs and so you can log every real delta when debugging (`prompt_valet/ui/app.py:39`).

Swapped the dashboard, submit, and services flows over to those helpers so job/target uploads, watcher/treebuilder statuses, and connectivity labels now stay stable unless a real change arrives, including badge classes and visibility flags (`prompt_valet/ui/app.py:225`, `prompt_valet/ui/app.py:872`, `prompt_valet/ui/app.py:1121`).

Added regression coverage for the gating helpers to prove repeated identical calls only hit the underlying element once (`tests/test_ui_boot.py:35-75`).

Tests:
- `black .`
- `ruff check .`
- `python3 -m compileall -q prompt_valet scripts`
- `pytest -q`

Suggestions:
1. Hit the UI in a browser (Dashboard/Submit/Services) to confirm the flicker is gone for each panel.
2. If you need extra confidence, start the UI with `PV_UI_DEBUG_REFRESH=1` so the logs report every actual update and you can verify the gating works end-to-end.
