Submit panel now pins repo/branch selections through dedicated refresh helpers so branch changes no longer reset the repo selection.

- Helper-driven refresh functions (`prompt_valet/ui/app.py:968`) centralize `selected_repo`/`selected_branch` state and explicitly set `select.value` before NiceGUI sees the options, keeping choices stable.
- `_refresh_targets` (`prompt_valet/ui/app.py:990`) uses those helpers to rebuild repo/branch lists, preserve valid selections, and update button status text without overwriting repo state.
- Repo/branch change handlers (`prompt_valet/ui/app.py:1041`) now only touch their own selection and rely on the helpers to refresh downstream options, preventing branch interactions from mutating the repo selector.
- Tests: `ruff check .`, `black .`, `pytest -q`.
- Next step: manually exercise the Submit tab (pick repo B, branch X, change branches, reload targets) to confirm the repo choice remains steady.
