**Phase 2 Closed**
- Captured the Phase 2 debrief, appliance behavior, DRY RUN/full install instructions, validation/success criteria, troubleshooting notes, CI posture, provenance summary, and closure declaration in `docs/Phase2_Debrief.md:1`, with the Block A findings and plan recorded in `docs/analysis/P2-C4-analysis.md:1`.
- Added the final “How Phase 3 Wizard & Phase 4 TUI integrate with the installer” section to `docs/installer_contract.md:98`, describing how the UIs export the documented `PV_*` surface, leverage `PV_VALIDATE_ONLY=1`, and wrap the deterministic, idempotent installer instead of reimplementing it.
- Updated both roadmaps so the new P2·C4 entry and the “Phase 2 — CLOSED” notice appear in `docs/phase-roadmap.md:20`/`docs/phase-roadmap.md:25` and `docs/Phase_Roadmap.md:20`/`docs/Phase_Roadmap.md:25`, confirming every checkpoint (P2·C1–P2·C4) is complete.

**Verification**
- Confirmed the manual run guidance is present at `docs/Phase2_Debrief.md:11` (dry run) and `docs/Phase2_Debrief.md:22` (full install), the integration notes live at `docs/installer_contract.md:98`, and both roadmaps list the completed checkpoints plus closure statements at `docs/phase-roadmap.md:1`/`docs/phase-roadmap.md:25` and `docs/Phase_Roadmap.md:1`/`docs/Phase_Roadmap.md:25`.
- Tests: not run (not requested).

Next steps: Phase 3 Wizard/Phase 4 TUI work can now proceed using the shared installer interface and the Phase 2 debrief as their reference materials.
