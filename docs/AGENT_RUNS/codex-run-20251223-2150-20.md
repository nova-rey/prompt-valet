**Ops work**
- Captured service topology, configuration surface (env/defaults), restart expectations, acceptance checklist, and non-goals for P1·C6 in `docs/analysis/p1-c6-hardening-and-ops.md:1`, so operators know how the watcher and API handshake, what env overrides exist, and what endurance checks to run.
- Defined the API systemd unit and optional user/privilege handling plus the `/etc/prompt-valet/pv.env` template so the service can load its runtime overrides (see `ops/systemd/prompt-valet-api.service:1` and `ops/env/pv.env.example:1`). The unit keeps the API under systemd supervision while relying on an environment file, as required.
- Added the operator guide and the acceptance checklist that spell out dependency installation, service start/stop commands, health/job/log/abort interactions, and formal acceptance records (`docs/ops/phase1-operator-guide.md:1`, `docs/ops/phase1-acceptance-checklist.md:1`).
- Recorded completion of P1·C6 with a factual note that the new artifacts were added without any runtime behavior changes (`PHASE_CHECKLIST.md:1`).

**Testing**
- `ruff check .` (pass)
- `black --check .` (pass)
- `pytest -q` (pass, 63 tests)

**Next steps**
1. Copy the new unit and env template into `/etc` on the target host, edit `/etc/prompt-valet/pv.env`, and start `prompt-valet-api.service` per the guide.
2. Run through the acceptance checklist with a real job to prove submission, logging, and abort flows work from the service.
