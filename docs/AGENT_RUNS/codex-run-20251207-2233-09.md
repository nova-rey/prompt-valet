**Changes**
- Config loading now consults `PV_CONFIG_PATH`, logs whether `/srv/prompt-valet/config/prompt-valet.yaml` was found, and returns an `upstream_enabled` flag so we clearly run in local-only mode when config is absent (see `scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py:122-178`).
- Upstream reconciliation is now guarded by `upstream_enabled`; missing upstream repos just log warnings, and the main loop explicitly leaves non-cloned inbox roots untouched instead of invalidating them (`scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py:459-534`).
- Captured the analysis/plan in `docs/analysis/mp-inbox-upstream-fix.md` and expanded `tests/test_rebuild_inbox_tree_upstream.py` with coverage for config-missing local-only runs, upstream errors, and git-owner usage (`docs/analysis/mp-inbox-upstream-fix.md:1-54`; `tests/test_rebuild_inbox_tree_upstream.py:219-315`).

**Confirmations**
- With config missing, startup now logs `upstream discovery disabled; running in local-only mode.` (see `scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py:140-175`) and `test_missing_config_runs_local_only_mode` confirms a valid `nova-process` inbox root persists without `ERROR.md` (`tests/test_rebuild_inbox_tree_upstream.py:219-251`).
- When config is present, `test_upstream_enabled_uses_config_owner` shows upstream discovery queried the configured owner, and `test_upstream_error_does_not_invalidate` proves upstream failures are logged but never create `ERROR.md` (`tests/test_rebuild_inbox_tree_upstream.py:253-315`).
- Because `reconcile_upstream_repo` no longer calls `mark_inbox_root_invalid` for missing upstream repos, the old `"Inbox root 'nova-process' has no real repo; resetting and dropping ERROR.md."` cleanup path has been retired (`scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py:459-490`).

**Validation**
- `pytest -q`
- `black scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py tests/test_rebuild_inbox_tree_upstream.py`
- `ruff check scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py tests/test_rebuild_inbox_tree_upstream.py`

**Modified Files**
- `scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py`
- `tests/test_rebuild_inbox_tree_upstream.py`
- `docs/analysis/mp-inbox-upstream-fix.md`

Note: the repository also reports existing `__pycache__` diffs (e.g., `scripts/__pycache__/…`, `tests/__pycache__/…`); those were already present and were not altered here.
