Centralized inbox-root selection so overrides/config drive the true inbox path while retaining `/srv/prompt-valet/inbox` as the fallback.

- Added `DEFAULT_INBOX_ROOT`/`DEFAULT_REPOS_ROOT` defaults so overrides have a known install path to compare against once runtime logic starts (scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py:81).
- Introduced `resolve_inbox_root` so monkeypatched globals or config values feed into one resolver before the script ever makes filesystem decisions (scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py:130).
- `load_config` now logs the resolved root so the warning mirrors what the rest of the script will honor instead of always claiming `/srv/prompt-valet/inbox` (scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py:191).
- `main` reassigns `INBOX_ROOT` to that resolved value before `mkdir`, which lets tests stay under their tmp inboxes while production still defaults to `/srv/prompt-valet/inbox` (scripts/rebuild_inbox_tree.py:612).
- Tests: `pytest -q`.
