- Added `tests/test_basic_ci.py:1` to verify that the key scripts exist and compile, that they reference `/srv/prompt-valet/config/prompt-valet.yaml` with the expected logging contract, and that `configs/prompt-valet.yaml` parses with the required sections—no runtime files were touched and no path adjustments were needed.
- Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml:1` defining a matrix `pytest -q` job (blocking) plus Ruff/Black installs that run in soft mode (`continue-on-error: true`) so CI now enforces tests while lint remains advisory.
- Tests were not run locally; CI is set to run `pytest -q` and the lint job already soft-fails as required.

Next steps: (1) let CI run these jobs on push or PR, and (2) if you need local confirmation, run `pytest -q` (and optionally `ruff check .`, `black --check .`) in your environment.
